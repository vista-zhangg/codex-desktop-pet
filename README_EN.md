> [!IMPORTANT]
> AgentPaw currently supports **Windows x64 only**. macOS, Linux, and Windows on ARM are not supported. Documentation is available in Chinese and English; the application UI is currently Simplified Chinese. The Windows binaries are not commercially code-signed yet, so SmartScreen may display a warning on first launch.

**AgentPaw · AI Desktop Companion** is an independent open-source project, not affiliated with OpenAI or Anthropic. It combines a Codex desktop pet, Claude Code companion, task notifications, and an agent usage monitor. The executable is `AgentPaw.exe`; data lives in `~/.agentpaw/`. First launch copies settings, characters, and history from earlier versions while keeping the original data as a recovery backup.

## What it does

**Free and non-profit, built for personal desktop companionship, learning, and sharing.** No paid character packs or paid downloads. Third-party artwork is separate from the MIT-licensed code; see [creator accounts, credits, and artwork terms](assets/CREDITS.md).

Keep Codex progress, 5h / 7d subscription quota, and token usage on your desktop, alongside sessions from your other AI coding tools. AgentPaw asks for attention when a task needs you and celebrates completed turns. Water, stretch, and eye-rest reminders follow your time at the computer even when no AI task is running, in both character and compact capsule modes.

- **One companion, six agents** — Codex, Claude Code, TRAE, WorkBuddy, opencode, and ZCode.
- **Multiple characters and custom GIF pets** — switch characters, create one from an idle GIF, or import an entire state pack. Each character keeps independent edits and reset defaults.
- **Status at a glance** — working, thinking, parallel tasks, compaction, permission waits, user input, completion, errors, breaks, and sleep; background tasks and scheduled wakeups stay active until they actually clear.
- **Custom expressions** — browse every state GIF, add rotating variants, replace or remove a selected item, or restore defaults.
- **Native permission cards** — allow, deny, or permanently allow supported Claude Code requests from the pet.
- **Calmer task notifications** — choose Standard or Needs attention only, combine completion notices, defer transient failures, and mute an agent or project while keeping permission cards available.
- **Recent events and session preferences** — review recent activity in the action center, label or follow sessions, return to a task, and optionally set global shortcuts. Shortcuts are disabled by default.
- **Unified usage view** — tokens, cache reads and writes, context windows, models, daily trends, and API-price estimates.
- **Check Codex quota without opening Codex** — startup automatically discovers the native Codex Desktop CLI. The tray uses the independent AgentPaw brand icon; right-click the AgentPaw tray icon to see the masked current account, 5h / 7d remaining quota, reset times, and the last update. Missing windows stay `--`, with no manual setup required.
- **Integration health and repair** — verify all six agents, then repair or remove AgentPaw-managed integrations from Settings.
- **One-click privacy mode** — right-click the companion to toggle the compact ON/OFF control, or use Settings, while keeping essential state and usage visible.
- **Local-first operation** — conversations and usage stay on the machine; models.dev supplies public pricing while Codex authenticates and reads its own subscription quota.
- **Desktop-friendly controls** — drag, edge snapping, work peek, action center, system tray, auto-start, and scheduled break animations.
- **Reminders for your workday** — water, stretch, and eye-rest reminders run independently of AI activity in both character and capsule modes. Set each interval and snooze duration, turn reminders on or off individually or together, or skip a reminder for today.
- **Fullscreen and temporary quiet** — hide automatically during fullscreen use and restore afterward, or stay quiet for 15 / 30 / 60 minutes or a custom duration. Both modes share the existing window-hiding behavior while monitoring continues in the background. A manually hidden companion stays hidden until you explicitly show it.

## Real state examples

Built-in characters include **Salary Cat**, **Milk Tea Mouse (BOBARAT)**, **Mimi Bee (小蜜蜂蜜蜜)**, and **Line Dog (线条小狗 / Maltese)**. Milk Tea Mouse was created by **Achi (阿翅)**; the official account is **奶茶鼠的想法**. See [full attribution](assets/characters/milktea-mouse/CREDITS.md). Mimi Bee was created by **花栗鼠发发**, formerly known as **花栗鼠 Toby**; see [creator credits and sources](assets/characters/mimi-bee/CREDITS.md). Custom character packs use the same task states.

Milk Tea Mouse includes **83 built-in GIFs** across 16 states, including dedicated sleep, doze, and yawn animations. Each state remains independently editable.

Line Dog includes **58 animations** selected from WeChat sticker packs 1–4. Created by **Moonlab Studio (moonlab_studio)**; the official Chinese account is **线条小狗Maltese**. See [creator credits and artwork notes](assets/characters/line-dog/CREDITS.md).

See [cat artwork attribution](assets/cat/CREDITS.md), [milk tea mouse artwork notes](assets/characters/milktea-mouse/CREDITS.md), [Mimi Bee artwork notes](assets/characters/mimi-bee/CREDITS.md), and [Line Dog artwork notes](assets/characters/line-dog/CREDITS.md). The application icon is independent of character artwork.

## Custom state expressions

Open Settings → **Characters & expressions**, choose a character, and browse every work, feedback, and ambient state. You can also create a custom pet or [import a character pack](docs/character-packs.md). For the selected state you can:

- keep the current expressions and **add a rotating variant**;
- select any built-in or custom GIF in the playlist and replace or remove only that item; built-in files and imported source files are never deleted;
- keep at least one GIF per state, or restore all of the state's built-in defaults at once.

Imports are fitted to AgentPaw's 120 × 120 pet canvas. Transparent backgrounds are preserved, while a detached solid-color border is removed when it can be detected safely. Complex backgrounds are kept to avoid damaging the subject, with a warning shown in Settings. Limits are 12 MB, 2048 × 2048, 180 frames, and 60 seconds per GIF; each state accepts up to 20 custom expressions.

AgentPaw stores only a processed copy under `~/.agentpaw/pet-assets` for the current user. It never changes or deletes the source file, and saved expressions update the visible pet immediately without a restart. Users are responsible for the rights to assets they import.

## Support matrix

| Agent | Integration | External configuration | In-pet approval |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | Incremental local rollout JSONL reader; official App Server quota notifications | Does not modify Codex configuration or read credential files | Read-only alerts |
| Claude Code | Lifecycle hooks, transcript, and process data | Merge-safe AgentPaw hook install/uninstall | Supported |
| TRAE | Local IDE logs and process data | Installs a merge-safe hook only when TRAE is detected | Read-only alerts |
| WorkBuddy | Hooks, transcripts, and usage fields | Installs a merge-safe hook only when WorkBuddy is detected | Read-only alerts |
| opencode | Official plugin mechanism, events, and usage file | Installs/removes one standalone plugin file | Read-only alerts |
| ZCode | Lifecycle hooks via `hook/zcode-hook.js` (event name arrives in the stdin payload) and a read-only poller over ZCode's `model_usage` SQLite ledger | Merge-safe install/uninstall of the hook block in `~/.zcode/cli/config.json` | Read-only alerts |

On first launch, AgentPaw only integrates with tools already used by the current Windows account. It does not create configuration folders for undetected agents. Codex is always read-only and requires no hook.

## Install and run

### Release builds

Download the installer from the [latest release](https://github.com/vista-zhangg/codex-desktop-pet/releases/latest):

- `AgentPaw-<version>-Windows-x64.exe` — the only supported Windows x64 NSIS installer.

Starting with 1.7.0, releases do not offer source/npm deployment or a portable ZIP. Install the EXE before use; do not run the app directly from an archive or source checkout.

### Development and contribution

Source startup, testing, and local packaging commands are for developers and contributors only; see the [local development and packaging guide](docs/LOCAL_DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Developer commands

Developer `npm` commands, regression tests, and the EXE packaging flow are documented in the [local development and packaging guide](docs/LOCAL_DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Data and privacy

- Configuration, runtime tokens, pricing cache, and usage ledgers live in `~/.agentpaw/`.
- Claude Code, Codex, TRAE, WorkBuddy, opencode, and ZCode session data is read and processed locally.
- The local HTTP service binds to loopback only, and write endpoints require a fresh per-run token.
- models.dev synchronization downloads a public price list only; transcripts, rollouts, permission contents, and usage statistics are not uploaded.
- Codex quota uses one long-lived `codex app-server --stdio` connection. AgentPaw confirms the current account with `account/read` before reading quota and listening for updates. Codex owns authentication and upstream requests; AgentPaw does not read the contents of `~/.codex/auth.json` or call ChatGPT web endpoints. With file auth, replacing `auth.json` triggers an immediate reconnect. Keyring, auto, and ephemeral auth have no watchable file-event contract, so account changes converge through App Server account notifications, periodic `account/read`, and scheduled connection recycling. The UI therefore represents the account visible to AgentPaw's own App Server connection; it does not promise that a non-file auth switch in another process is detected immediately by the file watcher.
- Privacy mode from the cat menu or Settings masks on-screen details only; local monitoring and usage accounting continue, and pending items return when it is disabled.
- Displayed cost is an estimate based on public API prices, not a subscription bill or a provider’s final invoice.

See [Privacy and data boundaries](docs/PRIVACY.md) for the complete bilingual policy.

## How it works

```text
Claude hooks ─────┐
Codex rollouts ───┼──> local server / watchers ──> adapter / core ──> pet + details panel
TRAE logs ────────┤                                      └────────> unified usage ledger
WorkBuddy ────────┤
opencode plugin ──┤
ZCode hook/DB ────┘
Codex App Server ─────> tray context menu (5h / 7d) + low-quota bubble
```

The main process owns watcher lifecycles, the tray, and windows. The backend state machine aggregates concurrent sessions. Renderers only receive a reduced status and event protocol. State vocabulary and priority are defined once in [`shared/states.js`](shared/states.js).
